//! Runtime-agnostic synchronization primitives for asynchronous Rust.
//!
//! `asyncband` provides locks, initialization tools, task coordination, channels, and workload
//! controls without tying an application to a particular async runtime. The primitives use standard
//! futures and wakers, so they can run on Tokio, async-std, smol, or a custom executor.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Public APIs are enabled through opt-in Cargo features, and no features are enabled by default.
//! Enable the APIs your application needs:
//!
//! ```toml
//! asyncband = { version = "0.7", features = ["mutex", "oneshot"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Then use the selected primitives directly:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! use asyncband::mutex::Mutex;
//!
//! let counter = Mutex::new(0);
//! {
//!     let mut value = counter.lock().await;
//!     *value += 1;
//! }
//! assert_eq!(*counter.lock().await, 1);
//! # }
//! ```
//!

//! # Runtime and blocking model
//!
//! The async primitives do not start threads, spawn tasks, or require a runtime-specific reactor.
//! Await them inside any executor that polls standard Rust futures.
//!
//! Async APIs are the primary interface. The optional [`blocking`] module is a boundary adapter for
//! synchronous callers: its single-future executor parks the calling thread and resumes it through
//! the future's waker. It is not a general-purpose async runtime, and futures that depend on a
//! runtime-specific timer or I/O driver may not make progress. See the module documentation for the
//! full execution constraints.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! Primitives and guards implement `Send` and `Sync` only when their protected or transferred
//! values satisfy the required bounds. Consult each type's documentation for its exact contract.
//!
//! # Disclaimer
//!
//! Apache Asyncband (Incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
//! Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
//!
//! Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
//! infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner
//! consistent with other successful ASF projects.
//!
//! While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
//! code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
