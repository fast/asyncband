//! A multi-producer multi-consumer broadcast channel with an unbounded buffer.
//!
//! This channel supports multiple senders and multiple receivers. Each message sent by any
//! sender is received by all active receivers. If a receiver falls behind, messages are buffered
//! until the receiver consumes them or is dropped.
//!
//! # Memory usage
//!
//! This channel does not impose a capacity limit. A slow or stalled receiver can cause the
//! buffer to grow without bound, because messages are retained until every active receiver has
//! consumed them or the receiver is dropped. Use [`Sender::buffer_len`] to monitor the number of
//! messages currently retained by the shared buffer.
//!
//! The buffer keeps the capacity a steady workload needs, so a channel that repeatedly fills and
//! drains does not reallocate. Capacity grown for a one-off burst is released once a later cycle
//! drains completely without needing it.
//!
//! # Receivers
//!
//! Each receiver has an independent cursor. Use [`Sender::subscribe`] to create a receiver that
//! starts at the current tail of the channel, [`Receiver::clone`] to create one that shares this
//! receiver's unread backlog, or [`Receiver::resubscribe`] to skip this receiver's backlog and
//! start a new receiver at the current tail.
//!
//! Messages are reclaimed once the slowest receiver moves past them, which scans one slot per
//! receiver. Only the receive that advances the slowest cursor pays for that scan, and the channel
//! keeps a slot for every receiver it hands out, so the cost follows the largest number of
//! receivers that were ever active at once rather than the number active now.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage:
//!
//! ```
//! use asyncband::broadcast::unbounded;
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! let (tx, mut rx1) = unbounded::channel();
//! let mut rx2 = tx.subscribe();
//!
//! tx.send(10);
//! tx.send(20);
//!
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(10));
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(20));
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(10));
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(20));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Slow receivers do not miss messages:
//!
//! ```
//! use asyncband::broadcast::unbounded;
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! let (tx, mut rx1) = unbounded::channel();
//! let mut rx2 = tx.subscribe();
//!
//! tx.send(1);
//! tx.send(2);
//!
//! // One receiver draining the channel does not discard what the other has not read yet.
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(1));
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(2));
//! assert_eq!(tx.buffer_len(), 2);
//!
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(1));
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(2));
//! assert_eq!(tx.buffer_len(), 0);
//! # }
//! ```
